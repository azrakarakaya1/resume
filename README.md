# resume
My personal resume created with HTML and CSS.

The goal was to create a visually appealing and well-structured resume that shows my skills, education, and experiences. I focused on semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and simplicity,  also used CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness. By combining these, I developed a resume that is simple to browse and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
